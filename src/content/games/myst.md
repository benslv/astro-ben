I feel like Myst has been sitting at the back of my mind for a while now, as a game that I "really ought to try out at some point". I don't really play many single-player games nowadays, and I play even _fewer_ puzzle games, so I was a bit apprehensive to pick it up for fear that I wouldn't be able to make even the tiniest little dent into the game.

I'd heard somewhere that Myst had a reputation for being the de facto puzzle game for fans of the genre, so I was a bit worried that also meant it would be _really hard_. Luckily I didn't find that to be the case and, dare I say, it was even quite a fun game! Honestly I was completely lost as to what to do when I first arrived on Myst Island, but it becomes apparent that that's sort of the point? You really do just need to explore as much as possible, interact with everything you can, and try to make connections between things to figure out how the game works. I really loved the use of sound clues in the game, too, which added a great level of depth to solving the puzzles.

Also worth quickly shouting out the the [Universal Hint System](https://www.uhs-hints.com/uhsweb/myst.php) for being a great resource while playing. It was super helpful to be able to get just the tiniest little hint possible to help you keep moving, without spoiling an entire section of the game. I didn't find myself looking at it that much once I'd figured out the style of thinking the game required but it was invaluable at the beginning for getting started, otherwise I might've bounced off.

I played the 2021 version of Myst, remastered with Unreal Engine 4, and it was absolutely _gorgeous_. Looking forward to playing the sequel, Riven, very soon!
